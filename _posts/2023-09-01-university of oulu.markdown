description: During my internship at the University of Oulu I was tasked with re-creating old PHP&Laravel web-apps with their new framework of choice, Vaadin. In addition, I developed GraphQL API endpoints for these new applications. I worked on internal personnel identity management -related full-stack web applications utilizing technologies such as Vaadin, Java, SpringBoot, GraphQL and SQL. During my internship I also wrote my university thesis, in which I discuss the development of one of my projects during the internship, a full-stack web application for the meeting room displays of the university. https://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:amk-2023112130773/
